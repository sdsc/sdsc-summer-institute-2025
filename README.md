## Additional SDSC Resources
### Voyager
[Voyager](https://www.sdsc.edu/systems/voyager/index.html) is an [Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support (ACCESS)](https://access-ci.org/) innovative AI system designed specifically for science and engineering research at scale. Voyager is focused on supporting research in science and engineering that is increasingly dependent upon artificial intelligence and deep learning as a critical element in the experimental and/or computational work. Featuring the Habana Gaudi training and first-generation Habana inference processors, along with a high-performance, low latency 400 gigabit-per-second interconnect from Arista. Voyager will give researchers the ability to work with extremely large data sets using standard AI tools, like TensorFlow and PyTorch, or develop their own deep learning models using developer tools and libraries from Habana Labs.

Voyager is an NSF-funded system, developed in collaboration with Supermicro, and Intel’s Habana Lab and operated by the San Diego Supercomputer Center at UC San Diego, and began a 3-year testbed phase in early 2022.
