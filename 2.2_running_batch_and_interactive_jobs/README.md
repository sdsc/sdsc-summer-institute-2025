### SDSC Summer Institute 2025
# Session 2.2 Running Batch and Interactive Jobs

**Date:** Monday, August 4, 2025

**Summary**: 
This session consists of two topics: 
1. Running batch jobs: This talk will introduce you to the concept of batch job schedulers — what they are, why they exist, and how they work — using the Slurm Workload Manager as our reference implementation and testbed. You will then learn how to write your first job script and submit it to an HPC System running Slurm as its scheduler. We will also discuss the best practices for how to structure your batch job scripts, teach you how to leverage Slurm environment variables, and provide tips on how to request resources from the scheduler to get your work done faster.
2. Interactive computing: Interactive high-performance computing (HPC) involves real-time user inputs that result in actions being performed on HPC compute nodes. This session presents an overview of interactive computing tools and methods.
