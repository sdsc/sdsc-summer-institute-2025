    "*   **Threaded Scheduler (`scheduler='threads'`):** All tasks run in threads within a single process. Because the `fib` function is pure Python code, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents threads from running in parallel. The tasks will execute serially, one after another. The total time will be approximately the sum of the time for all tasks.\n",
