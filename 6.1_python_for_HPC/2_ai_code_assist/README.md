# Python Development with AI Code Assistants

This guide provides a brief overview of setting up AI code assistants for Python development, focusing on VS Code with GitHub Copilot and the Gemini CLI.

## 1. VS Code + GitHub Copilot

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is a popular free code editor.
*   [Official VS Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)

**GitHub Copilot** is an AI pair programmer that provides autocompletion-style suggestions as you code.
*   [Official GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)
*   **Academic Discount**: GitHub Copilot Pro is available for free to students, teachers, and maintainers of popular open-source repositories. You can apply for this through the GitHub Student Developer Pack.
    *   [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/pack)

## 2. Gemini CLI

The **Gemini CLI** is an open-source AI agent that allows users to access the Gemini AI model directly from their terminal, assisting with various software engineering tasks.

**Note**: You cannot use these AI assistants directly on Expanse. Instead, develop locally, push your changes to GitHub, and then pull them from Expanse.
